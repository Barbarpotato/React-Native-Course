# Exercise: Your first React Native component

## Overview 
So far, you have learned what React Native components are and how to build a simple, reusable React component. In this activity, you will practice creating another reusable React component for the Little Lemon mobile app. This will enable you to efficiently create React components and reuse them across your mobile app.

## Scenario
The Little Lemon app has a header component at the top that reads Little Lemon. However, you have also been asked to create a footer component for the app. You will use the Text and View components from React Native to achieve this. These components will then display the copyright information on all screens and appear at the very bottom of the screen, as illustrated in the image below:

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create Footer Component
Your first step is to create a footer component. The footer component should display the following text:
`All rights reserved by Little Lemon, 2022`

### Step 2: Style Footer Component 
In this step, you will add styles to your footer component. This is a creative process, so you can choose styles based on your ideas, such as font size and colors.

### Step 3: Call Footer Component from App Component
In the final step, you will import the footer component and render it from the app component. This ensures that the footer text is rendered on the screen.

## Conclusion
By completing this exercise, you will demonstrate your understanding and ability to create reusable React components in React Native apps. You have shown how to use some of the core components in React Native, such as View and Text, while building the React component for the footer.
