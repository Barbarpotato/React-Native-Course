# Exercise: Build a scrollable component

## Scenario
The Little Lemon app has a Welcome screen that is demonstrated in the image below. Currently, this screen is not scrollable. Because of the large font size used for the text, the contents do not fit within the confines of one screen, and users cannot view the content in full.

In order to make the content accessible, you have been asked to enhance the Welcome screen from the previous exercise to make it scrollable. You should also make sure that the scroll indicator is white, so it matches the Welcome screen styles.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Enhance the Welcome screen to be Scrollable
In this step, you will use the existing code for the Welcome screen and enhance it to be a scrollable screen instead. Here you can use the ScrollView component, instead of the View component.

### Step 2: Ensure that the scroll indicator is white in color
Next, you will include a prop to the ScrollView component to ensure that the scroll indicator is white in color.

### Conclusion
By completing this exercise, you will demonstrate your understanding and ability to create scrollable views. You will demonstrate how to use the ScrollView component from React Native while building the Welcome screen for Little Lemon.
