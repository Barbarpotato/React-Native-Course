# Exercise: Style a component
## Scenario   
The Little Lemon app currently has some styling applied to the components. However, you have been asked to update the styling to achieve a different appearance. You should utilize the StyleSheet API to abstract the styles from the componentâ€™s render. Make sure that the component code is readable and clean.  
Here is how the app currently appears:

![style-2](/Images/styling-2.png)

The colors displayed in the image above can be applied with the following values: 
`#EE9972, #333333, #EDEFEE, black and white.`

## Instructions
### Step 1: Update Styles of Components to match Scenario

## Conclusion
By completing this exercise, you will demonstrate your understanding and ability to style React Native components. You will have demonstrated how to use the StyleSheet  API to abstract away styles while keeping the component code clean and readable.
